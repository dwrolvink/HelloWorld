# Welcome to my Github!
Hi, you can create Issues here as a way to get in touch with me!

I'll try to show you around in this Github account.

## Dwrolvink.com
[Visit my website](http://www.dwrolvink.com). I made it so it translates .md files using a [Markdev](https://github.com/markserv/markserv) service. See here how I made that work: [Building my Website](http://www.dwrolvink.com/?view=coding/website/building_this_website). (The live code for my website [can be found here](https://github.com/dwrolvink/dwrolvink.github.io).

> My website is something I'll aim to keep around forever, even if I someday migrate away from Github. 
So if you never want to lose contact with me, that address is something to write down! 

You'll find redacted code writedowns there (more structured than what you'll find here), among other things.

## Linux and Webdev
[Linux](https://github.com/dwrolvink/Linux/blob/master/README.md) Here, I list all the writedowns I have for all my Linux projects. You can also look in [the directory above](https://github.com/dwrolvink/Linux/blob/master/) for smaller files / projects.

One of my big projects in the past year was contributing to the [Konishi](https://github.com/konishi-project) project. Activity there has dropped a bit as the main dev is doing some necessary rewrites atm. I helped setup the whole website on a donated AWS instance. For this I used Nginx, CloudFlare, Flask, & NodeJS.

For the Konishi project, I learned to write extensive installation scripts so the whole website installation could be done by running just one script. I aim to put all my finished Linux automations here: [GitAutomata](https://github.com/dwrolvink/gitautomata).
